Content management for family history.

This is very much in development, so expect constant churn and change.

I added some sample data for Charles Dickens to give an idea of how it works.
- [family group view](https://r12a.github.io/ancestry/tree?project=dickens&person=dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812)
- [detail view](https://r12a.github.io/ancestry/person?project=dickens&person=dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812)
- [pedigree view](https://r12a.github.io/ancestry/ancestors?project=dickens&person=dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812)
- [descendants view](https://r12a.github.io/ancestry/descendants?project=dickens&person=dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812)

This simple content management system (CMS) uses HTML, CSS and Javascript only, so it is useable in any web browser, on any operating system.  It has also been specifically designed to work on a local machine, without server access. Apart from the fact that this makes the application useable when out in the field (such as at a graveyard) without an internet connection, this also protects privacy by removing the need to upload personal data to a server.
